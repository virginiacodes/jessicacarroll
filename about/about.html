            Jessica is an actor and versatile vocal chameleon from London. She
            was raised in a theatre and performed in plays and musicals as a
            teen before going on to train at London Academy of Music and
            Dramatic Art (LAMDA) where she represented the school in the
            Carleton Hobbs Radio Drama Competition and found a love for the
            voice world. With a lot of grafting, Jessica has carved out an
            extensive voice career for herself in videogames, commercials,
            cartoons, radio, dubbing and is a regular in the TV and Film ADR
            circuit.

            Australian, London and even old-fashioned Norfolk, amongst a bunch
